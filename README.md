This game uses the break_eternity.js library: https://github.com/Patashu/break_eternity.js

Current Features:

Sexy and Smooth UI
4 Dimensions (will add more)

Planned Features:

Make the game have 8 Dimensions!
Antimatter Galaxies!
Prestige for IP! formula will be ([Antimatter]^0.00097657)-1
IP Upgrades!
Challenges! (gonna be a pain to code im pretty sure)
